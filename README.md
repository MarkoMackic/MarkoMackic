Blogging was never my thing, so there is currently nothing on this page, but might be in the future ( 15.10.2021 ) 

I have a broad set of interests:

* Music
  ~ life is pointless without it. 
  * Playing guitar
* Drinking
  * Mostly coffee and sometimes alcohol
* Nature
  ~ dearest to my heart
  * Skiing
  * Swiming ( I Really REally love water ) 
  * Hiking
  * Or just sitting under the tree and waiting for some apple to fall . 
* Observatory learning on these:
  * Psychology 
  * Philosophy
* Computer science ( programming and other shit, some of this I've done, some of these I'm exploring ) 
  * Web and shit
  * Runtimes 
  * High perfomance sofware ( we need to dig into that one very soon ) 
  * Software hardware interfaces
  * Storage systems
* Maunal work:
  * Welding
  * Assembling electonics

Character description:
* Lost in the world

Here are some projects of mine, but for now it's all shitty mostly, we'll see if we make something in the future.
Please ping me ( email is from now on my ultimate communication mechanism, too much cognitive load by all those (anti)social networks ) if you have a project proposal that's OSS and worth my time.
